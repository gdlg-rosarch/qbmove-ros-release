<<PackageHeader(qb_move_hardware_interface)>>
<<TOC(4)>>

This package is barely usable alone since it provides only the hardware interface for the ''qbroboticsÂ® qbmove'' device.

name = qb_move_hardware_interface
desc = This library inherits from the base device-independent [[qb_device_hardware_interface]] (therefore provides the same ROS API) and extends its features specifically for the ''qbmove''. In brief, it provides the specific transmission interface for the ''qbmove'', which is the only thing that is really device dependent, and exploits the same hardware interfaces properly initialized (cf. [[qb_device_hardware_interface]]), and the same Communication Handler to talk to the physical device (cf. [[qb_device_driver]]). Furthermore, it provides the following additional parameters.
param {
  0.name = ~command_with_position_and_preset
  0.type = boolean
  0.desc = Chose whether to control the ''qbmove'' using shaft position and stiffness preset references (when `true`), or directly using actuator position references (when `false`).
  1.default = true
  1.name = ~encoder_resolutions
  1.type = int
  1.desc = The device encoder resolutions, in range [`0`, `8`].
  1.default = 1
  2.name = ~preset_ticks_limit
  2.type = int
  2.desc = The ''qbmove'' stiffness preset upper limit, expressed in motor ''ticks''.
  1.default = 3000
}

{{{#!wiki caution
Be aware that it can be dangerous to change `encoder_resolutions` and `preset_ticks_limit` arbitrarily. These values '''must match''' their relative configurations set in the device.
